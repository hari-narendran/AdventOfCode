https://adventofcode.com/2023/about

Welcome to my Advent of Code 2023 repository! This repository contains my solutions to the daily coding puzzles from Advent of Code 2023.

About Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an annual event that delivers daily coding challenges from December 1st to December 25th. These puzzles are fun, educational, and provide a great way to improve problem-solving skills in various programming languages.

My Journey

I discovered Advent of Code in 2022 and immediately fell in love with the puzzles. In 2022, I solved some of the puzzles using JavaScript. For the 2023 challenges, I’ve switched to Python and solved several puzzles. My goal is to continue solving these puzzles whenever I can, and I hope to expand my skills by experimenting with different programming languages.
